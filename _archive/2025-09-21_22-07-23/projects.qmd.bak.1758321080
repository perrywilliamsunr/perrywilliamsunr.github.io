#### Ecological Diffusion Models & Forecasting
Reaction–diffusion models to predict spread of populations, invasives, and disease. Includes nonlinear/anisotropic diffusion, adaptive monitoring, and links among habitat, movement, and demography. Applications include sea otter recolonization (Alaska) and sage-grouse monitoring (Great Basin).  
**Representative publications:** Williams et al. 2017, 2018; Lu et al. 2020; Eisaguirre et al. 2021; Leach et al. 2022; Eisaguirre et al. 2023a.

#### Wildlife Demography & Harvest Management
Hierarchical demographic models of survival, reproduction, and movement to quantify density dependence, harvest, and environmental change. Case studies include sage-grouse dynamics, cackling goose harvest, and Golden Eagle survival.  
**Representative publications:** Golden et al. (in review); Acevedo et al. (in review); Williams 2015 (PhD); Byrne 2023 (MS); Pacific Flyway Council (2015).

#### Predator–Prey Dynamics & Human–Wildlife Conflict
When predator recovery meets people: sea otters and shellfisheries, ravens with anthropogenic subsidies, and black bear conflict under changing snow and frost regimes. Embeds predator–prey dynamics in diffusion frameworks to inform coexistence and policy.  
**Representative publications:** Shoemaker et al. (in review); Brockman et al. (accepted); Eisaguirre et al. 2023b; Williams et al. 2008.
