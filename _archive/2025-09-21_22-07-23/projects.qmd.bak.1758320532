### Ecological Diffusion Models & Forecasting
Reaction–diffusion models to predict spread of populations, invasives, and disease. Work includes nonlinear and anisotropic diffusion, adaptive monitoring, and links among habitat, movement, and demography. Applications include sea otter recolonization (Alaska) and sage-grouse monitoring (Great Basin).

**Representative publications:** Williams et al. 2017, 2018; Lu et al. 2020; Eisaguirre et al. 2021; Leach et al. 2022; Eisaguirre et al. 2023a.

### Wildlife Demography & Harvest Management
Hierarchical demographic models of survival, reproduction, and movement to quantify density dependence, harvest, and environmental change. Case studies include sage-grouse dynamics, cackling goose harvest, and Golden Eagle survival. Outputs support adaptive harvest frameworks.

**Representative publications:** Golden et al. (in review); Acevedo et al. (in review); Williams 2015 (PhD); Byrne 2023 (MS); Structured Decision-Making Report to the Pacific Flyway Council (2015).

### Predator–Prey Dynamics & Human–Wildlife Conflict
When predator recovery meets people: sea otters and shellfisheries, ravens with anthropogenic subsidies, and black bear conflict under changing snow and frost regimes. Embedding predator–prey dynamics in diffusion frameworks to inform coexistence and policy.

**Representative publications:** Shoemaker et al. (in review); Brockman et al. (accepted); Eisaguirre et al. 2023b; Williams et al. 2008.

### Integrating Movement Ecology Across Scales
Linking individual telemetry with population dynamics using step-selection, state-space, and mechanistic diffusion. Connect fine-scale choices to range dynamics to evaluate survival risk, colonization, and persistence for carnivores, game species, and threatened wildlife.

**Representative publications:** Eisaguirre et al. 2025 (*Ecology Letters*); Eisaguirre, Williams & Hooten 2024 (*Movement Ecology*); Keating 2021 (MS).

### Statistical & Computational Tools for Ecology
Bayesian model selection, multi-objective optimization, and hierarchical models for abundance and survival. Emphasis on dissemination through book chapters, extension publications, R packages, and workshops.

**Representative publications:** Blume et al. 2024 (*JWM*); Gerber & Williams 2020 (CRC Press); Williams 2015 (MS); Williams 2017 (MEE blog); Womble et al. 2017 (NPS).
