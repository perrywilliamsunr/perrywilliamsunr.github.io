<h4>Ecological Diffusion Models & Forecasting</h4>

Reaction–diffusion models to predict spread of populations, invasives, and disease. Includes nonlinear/anisotropic diffusion, adaptive monitoring, and links among habitat, movement, and demography. Applications include sea otter recolonization (Alaska) and sage-grouse monitoring (Great Basin).  
**Representative publications:** Williams et al. 2017, 2018; Lu et al. 2020; Eisaguirre et al. 2021; Leach et al. 2022; Eisaguirre et al. 2023a.

<h4>Wildlife Demography & Harvest Management</h4>

Hierarchical demographic models of survival, reproduction, and movement to quantify density dependence, harvest, and environmental change. Case studies include sage-grouse dynamics, cackling goose harvest, and Golden Eagle survival.  
**Representative publications:** Golden et al. (in review); Acevedo et al. (in review); Williams 2015 (PhD); Byrne 2023 (MS); Pacific Flyway Council (2015).

<h4>Predator–Prey Dynamics & Human–Wildlife Conflict</h4>

Sea otters and shellfisheries, ravens with anthropogenic subsidies, and black bear conflict under changing snow and frost regimes. Embeds predator–prey dynamics in diffusion frameworks to inform coexistence and policy.  
**Representative publications:** Shoemaker et al. (in review); Brockman et al. (accepted); Eisaguirre et al. 2023b; Williams et al. 2008.

<h4>Integrating Movement Ecology Across Scales</h4>

Links individual-level telemetry with population-level dynamics to bridge fine-scale behavior and range dynamics; connects step-selection, state-space, and mechanistic diffusion models.  
**Representative publications:** Eisaguirre et al. 2025; Eisaguirre, Williams & Hooten 2024; Keating 2021 (MS).

<h4>Statistical & Computational Tools for Ecology</h4>

Bayesian model selection, hierarchical abundance/survival models, and open-source software and training that disseminate quantitative tools for ecology.  
**Representative publications:** Blume et al. 2024; Gerber & Williams 2020; Womble et al. 2017.
