\section*{Overview}
I teach quantitative ecology and environmental science with a focus on inference, forecasting, and communicating uncertainty. My courses blend reproducible workflows (R, GitHub) with real ecological datasets and open materials.

\section*{Teaching Philosophy (Brief)}
I aim to build durable intuition for how natural systems change across space and time, and to give students the tools to ask—and answer—quantitative questions about the environment. My courses emphasize clarity of assumptions, transparent workflows, and scientific storytelling grounded in evidence.
