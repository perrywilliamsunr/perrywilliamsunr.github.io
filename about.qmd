I am an associate professor and department chair at the University of Nevada, Reno. My research focuses on spatiotemporal population dynamics, ecological diffusion, and forecasting under uncertainty. I work closely with management agencies to translate models into practice.

- Methods: hierarchical Bayesian models, reactionâ€“diffusion PDEs, MCMC
- Software: R (EcoDiffusion), C++ accelerators, PyTorch prototypes
- Systems: sage-grouse, sea otters, shrubland ecosystems
